# TRUE STORY HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IN CLACTON ON SEA!!! 

A disabled woman that requires 24-hour care, stranded in one room of her family home for the last four years. A husband that has sacrificed everything to look after her. To wash her. To dress her, cook for her, pull her from the chair she is stranded in to Place her on and off a commode, to lay her into bed every night. To comfort her through her crippling pain. To wipe away her tears of hopelessness. 

The story of three amazing children that have lost the fit and health mother they once had but have pulled together to love and care for her. A family determined not to let it beat them.  A local council that have done very little to help, have ignored her worsening needs for the last year and have left her stranded in a home they rent from them. Left her with only one way to get out: IN AN AMBULANCE!  To hear more click the like button and share. 


“Hello?” ... “Hello?” ... “HEEELLLLLOOOO???” …. “CAN ANYONE HEAR ME?”

This is a cry for help emanating from a tiny gap, a small and dark breathing hole that has been cleared away from a life collapsed. If you are passing by, going about your day, composing a shopping list, or planning the evening meal out with your friends, or looking forward to family time after a long hard day at the office, or factory, and you can hear this cry; I urge you to hurry and get your phone from out of your pocket; to turn on the torch and shine it into this hole. I know you may be unsure that you can hear any sound at all, I know that you may feel there is little you can do, but please trust that instinct to help the distressed that is beating in your chest, and crouch down here, look into my blinking eyes and listen closely. 

Good, I am glad that you did. We have been calling for a long time now. We have a small voice and the world up there beyond this disaster zone is a noisy one.  I am going to pull at the sides and try and make this hole a bit bigger so you can see inside a bit more. Once your eyes get used to the dark, and the dust has settled, don’t panic when you see, staring back at you, a blinking and dazed family, stranded and living their lives amongst this rubble of a life that has fallen in around them. 

With my crippled and helpless wife, three children, a determination to survive, and a hope for the future, we have been living here almost forgotten for years now. The life that we once lived was a normal one. We were two hard working parents with three happy children that enjoyed all the things the young enjoy. We had a dog and a loving home. There where once family days out. Birthday parties filled with smiles. There where cosy nights cuddled up together as we watched the telly and all that usual kind of stuff. We were a family busy making a past that we could look back upon with a warm feeling of accomplishment and fondness.  

Then, one day something struck hard into the family, out of the blue, and rocked its foundations. Pieces of our life started to fall in on us, slowly at first. Then larger chucks fell more frequently and eventually it all caved in around us. As a result of the blow my wife has been rendered severely disabled, and the children and I have been sheltering her and keeping her alive for years. If you want to help, let me tell you the details of this disaster as it happened.
